waps
R Function "waps" (weighted averages using phyloseq-class objects)  
For every i species, or higher level taxonomy, the observed optimum environmental levels of selected variables are estimated by computing the averages – weighted by the corresponding abundances values – of the variable values in the corresponding samples where the i species were identified. Species optima (uk), and species tolerances (tk), were computed using standard approaches.

rmprim
The bash script "rmprim" is a wrapper for cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/) allowing to trim primers in forward and reverse paired reads in FASTQ files ("Trimming paired-end reads").
