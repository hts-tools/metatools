/
The bash script "rmprim.sh" is a wrapper for cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/) allowing to trim primers in forward and reverse paired reads in FASTQ files ("Trimming paired-end reads")./
#
The script works on gzipped files from Illumina MiSeq, with names ending in * _R1_001_trim.fastq.gz and _R2_001_trim.fastq.gz *
