rmprim \
 \
The bash script "rmprim.sh" is a wrapper for cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/) allowing to trim primers in forward and reverse paired reads in FASTQ files ("Trimming paired-end reads"). \
#
The script works on gzipped files from Illumina MiSeq, with names ending in _R1_001.fastq.gz and _R2_001.fastq.gz, e.g.: /
B0115D1-PL1-C5_S35_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz /
B0115D1-PL1-C5_S35_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz /
